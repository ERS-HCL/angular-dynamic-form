# DynamicForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

Dynamic Form is a project where we are generating form screens based on a configuration (json) file. This Json file is the heart of the project. Developer can design a form by just defining different controls, validations, lables, and other items in the configuration file. 

Developer can also configure the API endpoint to connect it with remote apis, this is more like a cherry on a cake. Some of the notable features of this application are:
1. Configure form in Json, application layout service will create it accordingly at runtime
2. Configure control Validations
3. Configure API endpoint which will be used to send Form data
4. Configure response DTO
